PPresenter supports slide-timing and dynamics.
<P>
You start the show with <TT>g</TT>, and halt it
with <TT>h</TT>.
<P>
Start the timer now, and see the progress bar (bottom)
moving slowly forwards.

See the popup (press <TT>s</TT>) how this is done.

You can disable all extra's on the bottom via the
background menu.
