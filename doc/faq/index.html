<A HREF=../index.html>Portable Presenter</A> is a package designed to give
presentations.  It is a complicated packages, which requires a study off the
supplied documentation.  However, after that, still some questions may
remain which are not directly part of the PPresenter software, but are related to
running it.  I try to answer these questions on this page(s).

    <P>
    This can not be handled by PPresenter itself, but is a task of your
    windowing system (in UNIX's case the window-manager you are running)
    For each windowing system, the way to achieve this is different.
    Please contribute to the next list:
    <P>
    <DL>
    <DT><STRONG>WindowMaker</STRONG>
    <DD>Run your application. Select "Attributes..." from the menu you
        get when you push the right mouse button on the title bar.
        Chose "Window Attributes" for the selection-box, and then
        flag "Disable titlebar".  If you have accepted that, your border
        will disappear.
        <P>
    <DT><STRONG>Fvmw2</STRONG> (thanks to Slaven Radic)
    <DD>Add the line
<PRE>
   Style "Coll"    NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0
</PRE>
        to the configuration file <CODE>~/.fvwm2rc</CODE>, where
        <CODE>Coll</CODE> should be replaced by the capitalized name
        of your presentation script.
