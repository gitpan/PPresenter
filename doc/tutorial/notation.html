<A HREF=../../>Portable Presenter</A> is a package designed to give
presentations.  The presentation is written in Perl/Tk.
<A HREF=http://www.perl.org>Perl</A> is a weird language, and that's an
understatement: there are a few hundred ways to denote your information.
<P>
Basically, writing a presentation with PPresenter is writing option-lists.
On this page, I show a few ways how to denote these option-lists.

Now a few alternatives which each produce exactly the same result.
<PRE>
1.  $show->addSlide(-title   => 'my first show',
                    -reqtime => 30,
                    -text    => "These are two\nlines of text\n");
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>
2.  $show->addSlide('-title', 'my first show',
                    '-reqtime', 30,
                    '-text', 'These are two
    lines of text
    ');
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>
3.  $show->addSlide
        ( -title     => "my first show"
        , -reqtime   => '30'
        , -text      => &lt;&lt;TEXT
    These are two
    lines of text
    TEXT
        );
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>
4.  $show->addSlide(
        -title     => "my first show",
        -reqtime   => 30,
        -text      => &lt;&lt;TEXT);
    These are two
    lines of text
    TEXT
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>
5.  my @x = ( -title => "my first show", -reqtime => 30, '-text');
    $show->addSlide(@x, &lt;&lt;TEXT);
    These are two
    lines of text
    TEXT
</PRE>
Perl is a weird language...  Be very careful with the comma's and
semi-colons in relation to here-documents.  I prefer the third
notation, but this is just a very personal decission, which I violate
myself whenever I like.
