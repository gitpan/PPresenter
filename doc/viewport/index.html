<A HREF=../index.html>Portable Presenter</A> is a package designed to give
presentations.   A presentation is based on
<A HREF=../slide/index.html>slides</A>, which are shown on viewports.
<P>
There are two kinds of viewports:
<UL>
<LI>viewports without any controls: these are described on this page, and
<LI>exactly one viewport <A HREF=control.html>with controls</A>, showing
    the show's progress, with a background-menu, etc.
</UL>
When you use more than one viewport, usually the viewport with controls
will show slide-notes.  But none, or even more than one viewport showing
the notes is possible, too.

<H2><A NAME=howto>How to</A> create a viewport</H2>

<H4>Implicit creation</H4>

Do not add any viewports explicitly: PPresenter will create one for you.
You may specify the size of this viewport with the
<CODE>-geometry</CODE> option of the show's constructor
function <A HREF=../show/new.html>new()</A>.
<P>
If you specify the <CODE>-controlDisplay</CODE> variable at the
show's new(), then PPresenter will create a control viewport which
displays slide-notes.

<H4>Explicit creation</H4>

After the show's instantiation until you add your first
<A HREF=../slide/index.html>slide</A>, you can add viewports explicitly.
You can add as many viewport as you like, but only one can have controls.
See the <A HREF=#examples>examples below</A> how it can be used.

<H2><A NAME=options>Options for all viewport</H2>

<H4>About the windowing system</H4>
<DL>
<DT><B>-display =&gt;</B> <I>display</I>
<DD>On which visual should the viewport appear?  By default the screen
    which you are using (for X11 this value is taken from
    <CODE>$ENV{DISPLAY}</CODE>).
    <P>
<DT><B>-device =&gt;</B> <I>string</I>
<DD>Type of device.  This is important for the decoration.  Currently
    defined are <CODE>lcd</CODE>, <CODE>beamer</CODE>,
    and <CODE>printer</CODE>.
    Add a new device via the
    <A HREF=../decoration/index.html>decoration</A> method
    <CODE>addDevice()</CODE>.
    <P>
<DT><B>-geometry =&gt;</B> <I>geometry</I>
<DD>The requested size and location of the window.  This defaults
    to the <A HREF=../show/new.html>show's new()</A> option with the
    same name, which on its turn defaults to the size of the screen.
    <P>
<DT><B>-resizable =&gt;</B> <I>boolean</I>
<DD>Is the user permitted to resize the main window?  Usually not, so by default
    this is turned off (<CODE>0</CODE>).
    <P>
</DL>
There is no options to switch the title-bar off: this is an option for the
window-manager.  Each window-manager has its own way to achieve that.

<H4>About PPresenter</H4>
<DL>
<DT><B>-name =&gt;</B> <I>string</I>
<DT><B>-aliases =&gt; [</B> <I>string, ...</I> <B>]</B>
<DD>Name and optionally nicknames of the viewport.  Required when you
    address the viewports yourself.
    <P>
<DT><B>-hasControl =&gt;</B> <I>boolean</I>
<DD>Is this the control window?  There must be exactly one control window.
    <P>
<DT><B>-showSlideNotes =&gt;</B> <I>boolean</I>
<DD>Does this viewports show slidenotes, or slides.  If you create a
    window with controls, the default is notes (true, <CODE>1</CODE>).
    For other windows, the default is slides (false, <CODE>0</CODE>).
    <P>
<DT><B>-style =&gt;</B> <I>string</I>
<DD>Which <A HREF=../style/index.html>style</A> is used to describe the style.
    Viewports which show slidenotes have
    <A HREF=../style/slidenotes.html>style "slidenotes"</A> as default.
    Other viewports get by default the
    <A HREF=../function/select.html>selected</A>
    style (usually the <A HREF=../style/default.html>default style</A>).
    <P>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME=examples>Examples</A></H2>

<H4>Example 1: Implicit Creation</H4>

The easiest way to create one viewport for your show is just by
<EM>not</EM> using <CODE>addViewport</CODE>:
<PRE>
   use PPresenter;
   my $show = PPresenter->new();
</PRE>
Now you have only one viewport, with controls on that viewport.  The
viewport covers the whole screen, unless you specify a <CODE>-geometry</CODE>
with <CODE>new()</CODE>

<H4>Example 2: Implicit Creation with Control Viewport</H4>

If you want to have more than 1 viewport, you need a windowing system
which enables Tk to do this.  Currently, this is only tested for UNIX.
<PRE>
   use PPresenter;
   my $show = PPresenter->new
      ( -controlDisplay  =&gt; 'far.away.com:0'
      , -controlGeometry =&gt; '300x300+40+40'
      );
</PRE>
When you specify the <CODE>-controlDisplay</CODE> you will get two
viewports: one without controls and showing slides, the other
with controls, showing slide-notes.  The default geometry is
<CODE>'640x480'</CODE>.
As test, you may try:
<PRE>
   -controlDisplay =&gt; $ENV{DISPLAY}
</PRE>
but this is not useful in a practical situation.

<H4>Example 3: Explicit Creation of one viewport</H4>

Explicit creation of one single window is also not hard, as long as
you do not forget that one viewport --so this viewport-- requires
control:
<PRE>
   $show = PPresenter->new;
   $show->addViewport
      ( -display    =&gt; 'anywhere'
      , -hasControl =&gt; 1
      , -geometry   =&gt; '400x600+30-20'
      );
</PRE>
Because one viewport is explicitly added, PPresenter will not create one
for you.  To be more precize: if there is at least one viewport
which shows slides, then none is created automatically.
<P>
The number of options of a viewport with controls is much larger than
for a viewport without controls.  See the special section of
<A HREF=control.html#options>control options</A>.
