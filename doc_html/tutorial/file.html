<A HREF=../index.html>Portable Presenter</A> is a package designed to give
presentations.  The presentation is written in Perl/Tk.  There is no
graphical interface to design your slides, and I'm very pleased with
that.  If anyone want likes create one, he/she has my blessing.

<H2>The Basic Structure</H2>
In its most reduced form, a presentation should be a Perl-script
which contains the following lines:
<PRE>
     #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
     use PPresenter;

     my $show = PPresenter->new(<I>..options..</I>);

     $show->addViewport(<I>..options..</I>);
     <I>...</I>;

     $show->addSlide(<I>..options..</I>);
     $show->addSlide(<I>..options..</I>);
     <I>...</I>;

     $show->run;
</PRE>
As you can see, a presentation is easy to build.  The first line is to
satisfy a UNIX-system (do not forget to make the script executable).  On
Windows32, the script shall have extention <CODE>.pl</CODE>.
<P>
The difficult thing about writing slides with <EM>Portable Presenter</EM>
is to know which options are available and where to use them.
There are three groups of options:
<OL>
<LI>Options to <A HREF=new.html>new</A>, which are related to the creation of
    the whole presentation; basically about the screen(s) and controls.
<LI>Options to <A HREF=../viewport/index.html>viewports</A>.  Viewports
    is the name for a main window, or screen.  The term `screen' could not
    be used as own name because it is already defined in Perl/Tk.<BR>
    As user, you can say <CODE>Screen</CODE> instead of <CODE>Viewport</CODE>,
    whenever you like, except when you start writing styles.
<LI>Options to <A HREF=../slide/index.html>slides</A>, describing the way one
    slide should be handled.  These are <A HREF=../style/>style</A>-dependent,
    do you need to know which style you are using.
<LI>The <CODE>run</CODE> method has no options, because most facts which are
    about running the show have to be known when the slides are being
    processed.
</OL>
