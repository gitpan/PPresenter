If you didn't get the picture right now: in the previous chapters is all
you have to know about creating a presentation.  Yes, you have to learn
the options, and have to learn how the markup formatter works (I know: need
for a tutorial on that subject).
<P>
So, now you have the presentation ready on the content.  The next chapters
are to fine-tune your speach.  First we will try to get more specifics on
time requirements.  Then we will group sets of slides (to be able to skip
parts of your presentation).
<P>
In the beginning, we had a time requirement for the full show.  At that time,
we took the average of three minutes average per slide.  Now, we have to
try to be more specific: a time estimation per slide.  PPresenter can help you
to keep on schedule during you talk, and it is really adviceable to use this
help!

<H3><A NAME=notes>Slide Notes</A></H3>
How long do we need per slide?  The slides do only contain the key words and
key sentences on were you are talking about.  Now we completed the
initial version of the presentation, the details have to be filled in.  Very
useful is adding notes to your slides.  PPresenter has the possibility to display
those notes on a diffent screen or on paper, if you like.
<P>
Go through each slide and add the <CODE>-notes</CODE> option describing
which things you would like to talk about, for example:
<PRE>
   $show-&gt;addSlide
      ( -title    =&gt; 'Wildlife in Holland'
      , -main     =&gt; &lt;&lt;MAIN
In the wild you will find
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;bears
&lt;LI&gt;apes
&lt;LI&gt;spiders
&lt;/UL&gt;
MAIN
      , -notes    =&gt; &lt;&lt;NOTES
Situation of 100 million years back.
Why did spiders survive?
How did the climate change?
NOTES
      );
</PRE>
Some people like to write-out their story in detail, other can manage on
a global outline.  The reason for adding notes is to be able to read through
you presentation just before you will have it, to remember everything you
want to explain, and to estimate the required time.

<H3><A NAME=specs>Time Specifications</A></H3>

The default time for a slide is three minutes.  If you think you need a
different amount, add the line:
<PRE>
      , -reqtime   =&gt; '5m30'
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
      , -reqtime   =&gt; '3:30'
</PRE>
(many formats possible).
<P>
Next to adding times per slide, you specify the total time for the presentation
as option to new:
<PRE>
   my $show = PPresenter->new
      ( -name      =&gt; 'Wildlife'
      , -totaltime =&gt; '1h15m'
      );
</PRE>
<IMG SRC=../../viewport/slidecontrol.gif WIDTH=284 HEIGHT=262 ALIGN=right
 HSPACE=10>
Now, when you run the script (start the presentation), PPresenter will show how the
sum of the required times fits to the total time you have available.  Press
`<CODE>s</CODE>' in your presentation-<WBR>window to get a popup including
the table shown here right.
<P>
In for a big shock?: too much time required!  Response?  No, wrong response!r
Do never shorten the required time per slide unless you strip content,
otherwise you will have to hurry, which is deadly for your message.
<P>
The colours you see in the image show how the time used is related to the
time available.  Press `<CODE>g</CODE>' to start the timer.
