Basically, PPresenter is a library which can be used from a Perl program
directly.  However, not everyone prefers to write Perl, so you may like
the idea of a program which translates text-files into library calls.
<P>
The XML interpreter was written by Johan Vromans.  It implements a
substantial sub-set of the possibilities of the library in pure XML.
DTD's are included.

<H2>How to run</H2>

If you want to use the XML interpreter, you run:
<PRE>
    present myfile.xml
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
    present -xml myfile
</PRE>

<H2>How to use</H2>

Currently, there is no documentation on how to write presentations on XML.
However, there are two large examples included in the demo directory of
the sources: <CODE>xml/demo/*</CODE>.  These should be sufficient to
use this application.  Please contribute.
