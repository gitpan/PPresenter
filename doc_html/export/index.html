<A HREF=../index.html>Portable Presenter</A> is a package designed to give
presentations.  Sometimes, you may want to print the slides to create
hand-outs or for corrections.  You may also want to convert your presentation
into a website.  All use of the slide-data for other use than an
actual presentation is covered by this export modules.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=red>WARNINGS</FONT>:
<UL>
<LI>These exporters will only work on X11 (Unix) systems because it
    uses <CODE>xwd</CODE> to hardcopy the slides.<BR>
<LI>These exporters will only work if you have Image::Magick installed.
<LI>The undocumented exporters contain some problems (bugs/misfeatures).
</UL>
<P>
We are open to contributions.

<H2><A NAME=exporters>Export Modules</A></H2>

The following exports are currently implemented, have initial coding,
or are under study.  

<DL>
<DT><A HREF=website/html.html>PPresenter::Export::Website::HTML</A>
<DD>Converts slides and slide-notes into web-pages.  Slides can only be
    converted to images within the HTML pages.  In the future, it will
    also be possible to include the slide information as real HTML.
    <P>
<DT><A HREF=images/imagemagick.html>PPresenter::Export::Images::ImageMagick</A>
<DD>Convert all slides into images using Image::Magick.
    Each slide(view) as one seperate file, in hardly any imaginable format.
    <P>
<DT><B>PPresenter::Export::PostScript</B>
<DD>Convert slides into PostScript using standard Tk.
    Tk is able to produce real postscript, but only includes text in
    a character-size which may be close to the size you requested.  Images
    and such are not included.
    <P>
    The results are of such a poor quality that I refuse the documentation
    of this module to be included.
    <P>
<DT><B>PPresenter::Export::IM_PostScript</B>
<DD>Convert slides into PostScript using Image::Magick, but as images.
    This produces huge postscript files, and does not work perfectly yet.
    Apparently some misunderstanding between me and PerlMagick interface.
    <P>
    The results are not acceptable yet, but I promise documentation when
    this module works well enough.
</DL>

Exporters can only be used when the presentation is run, because most of
them hardcopy the screen.

<H2><A NAME=using>Using Exporters</A></H2>

Because this functionality is still under development, the use of exporters
is a bit more complicated than the other modules.
<P>
At first, you have to add exporters to your show:
<PRE>
    $show->addExporter(<I>package-name, options</I>);
</PRE>
You can find the packages in <CODE>PPresenter/<WBR>Export/</CODE>, for
instance: <CODE>'PPresenter::<WBR>Export::<WBR>IM_Images'</CODE> is a
valid package-name.
<P>
The other way to introduce an exporter is by creating an instance of
subclass of <CODE>PPresenter::<WBR>Export</CODE> yourself, and then have
that added:
<PRE>
    use PPresenter::Export::IM_Image;
    my $obj = PPresenter::Export::IM_Image->new(<I>options</I>);
    $show->addExporter($obj, <I>options</I>);
</PRE>
<P>
When the presentation is run, and you have added some exporters, you can
start them using the background-<WBR>menu.  If there are no exporters, then
you will not see the 'export' entry in menu.

<H2><A NAME=options>General Options</A></H2>

The <A HREF=../dynamic/index.html>Dynamic</A> module defines an option
<B>-exportPhases</B> which describes whether only the final stage of a
slide should be presented, or all, or a selection.
<P>
All exporters share the following options.
<DL>
<DT><B>-viewports =&gt;</B> <I>which</I>
<DD>Which viewports are selected to be included by default.  Possible
    values for <I>which</I> are:
    <DL>
    <DT><B>ALL</B>
    <DD>All of the visible slides.  If you have slidenotes, but not a
        visisble display of them, you won't get them because they cannot
        be copied from the screen.
    <DT><B>NOTES</B>
    <DD>Slidenotes, but only if visible on the screen.
    <DT><B>SLIDES</B>
    <DD>Viewports which do not show slidenotes.
    <DT><I>name</I> or <B>[</B> <I>list-of-names</I> <B>]</B>
    </DL>
    <P>
<DT><B>-exportSlide = &gt;</B> <I>which</I>
<DD>Which slides shall be included.
    Possible values for <I>which</I> are:
    <DL>
    <DT><B>ACTIVE</B>
    <DD>The currently selected slides.  See the slide-control menu to
        find-out which slides are selected.  The default.
    <DT><B>CURRENT</B>
    <DD>Only the currently visible slide.
    <DT><B>ALL</B>
    <DD>All slides, also the not selected slides.
    </DL>
    <P>
<DT><B>-imageFormat =&gt;</B> <I>format</I>
<DD>The required output format of images.  If you use ImageMagick (and
    that is the only way to get images on the moment) then you can get
    nearly all imaginable formats.
    <P>
    You may use the format name in upper- or in lowercase.  Common
    formats are <CODE>gif</CODE> (default), <CODE>jpg</CODE>, and
    <CODE>png</CODE>.
    <P>
<DT><B>-imageQuality =&gt;</B> <I>percentage</I>
<DD>Some image formats can compress better when they leave some information
    of the image away.  The smaller the value you specify here, the more
    image information is left-out.  The number of bytes required to store
    the image will be smaller, but the quality of the image will suffer.
    <P>
<DT><B>-imageWidth =&gt;</B> <I>pixels</I>
<DD>The width the resulting images will have.  The images are taken from
    the screen and resized (with anti-aliasing) to the specified size.
    <P>
    If you do not specify a size, the images will not be resized.  The
    height of the image will be resized with the same factor as the width.
