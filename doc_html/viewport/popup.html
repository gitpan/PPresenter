<A HREF=../index.html>Portable Presenter</A> is a package designed to give
presentations.  For serious presentations, timing is important: you want
to plan your show such that all <A HREF=../slide/index.html>slides</A>
get the time they require.
<P>
The full popup is shown on the right.  The popup has three parts:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF=#slidecontrol>slide control</A>
<LI><A HREF=#tagcontrol>tag control</A>
<LI>some buttons, which I will not describe here.
</OL>
In the near future, the timing and slide-selection information can be
saved and loaded, but this is not yet implemented.

<H2><A NAME=slidecontrol>Slide Control</A></H2>
The slide control window shows many details about the progress in time
of the presentation.
Slide control can be part of the popup or shown in the
<A HREF=control.html>control viewport</A> (depends on the control viewport's
<CODE>-includeControls</CODE> option).
<IMG SRC=slidecontrol.gif WIDTH=284 HEIGHT=262 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right>
<UL>
<LI>The left column is a list of checkboxes, showing
    <UL>
    <LI>how much time the slide requires (the <CODE>-reqtime</CODE>
        option of <A HREF=../slide/index.html>slides</A>;
    <LI>whether the slide is selected or not.
    </UL>
    <P>
<LI>The number on the bottom in the left column displays the total time
    required for the selected slide.  The color shows how this relates
    to the total available time (the <CODE>-totaltime</CODE> option
    of <A HREF=../show/new.html>show new()</A>.
    <P>
<LI>The central column shows the names of the slides.  This is a list
    of radiobuttons: on slide is <EM>on</EM>: currently on display.
    You can directly select one of the slides by pushing the button, even
    if the slide is not selected.
    <P>
<LI>Below the central column is written how many of the slides are
    selected in the first column.
    <P>
<LI>The right column shows for each slide
    <UL>
    <LI>how much time is spent on each of the slides, and
    <LI>in color, how this relates to the required time.
    </UL>
    <P>
<LI>The number on the bottom in right column shows
    <UL>
    <LI>the total time used, with
    <LI>in color how this relates to the total time available for the show.
        Again, the <CODE>-totaltime</CODE> option
        of <A HREF=../show/new.html>show new()</A>.
    </UL>
</UL>
The colors are defined by the <CODE>-progressColors</CODE> option of
the <A HREF=control.html>control viewport</A>.

<BR CLEAR=right>

<H2><A NAME=tagcontrol>Tag Control</A></H2>
The tagcontrol can be part of the popup or shown in the
<A HREF=control.html>control viewport</A> (depends on the control viewport's
<CODE>-includeControls</CODE> option).
<P>
When a <A HREF=../slide/index.html>slides</A> is added, you can provide
the <CODE>-tag</CODE> or </CODE>-tags</CODE> option.  All the used tags
are shown in the tag-control window.
<P>
With this window, you can select or unselect tagged groups of slides, for
instance if you want to use a sub-set of the slide for a shorter
presentation, or have a few different slides for a group of managers than
for a group of technicians.
<P>
With the <CODE>-tag</CODE> option of <A HREF=../show/new.html>show new()</A>
you can start with a certain selection.  All slides have at least tag
<CODE>'ALL'</CODE>.
<P>
<IMG SRC=tagcontrol.gif WIDTH=297 HEIGHT=262 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right>
The parts of the window:
<UL>
<LI>the tags found,
<LI>how often they were found,
<LI>how many of the slides with the tag are currently selected
    (see slide-control window, described above),
<LI>how many of the slides with the tag are currently disabled.
</UL>
The <EM>Set</EM> and <EM>Clear</EM> columns are buttons: if you push
them the related slides will be selected, resp. disabled.  The result
of this is immediately shown on all places.
