<A HREF=../index.html>Portable Presenter</A> is a package designed to give
presentations.  The presentation is written in Perl/Tk.
<P>
Perl/Tk is Object Oriented (OO).  Perl is deliberately providing you with
a lot of freedom in how to use OO.   Tk extended the OO mechanism, with a
set of funtions, but these extentions are not used in PPresenter for reason that
they are too `heavy': would complicate the software instead of helping it.

In the image on the right, you see that a <A HREF=../show/index.html>show</A> links
<A HREF=../slide/index.html>slides</A> to <A HREF=../viewport/index.html>viewports</A>.
Each slide may be shown in more than one window (viewport)
at the same time, each defined by a <A HREF=../slideview/index.html>slide-view</A>.
So, a slide-view is the data of a slide which is shown on one
specific viewport.
The data shown can be text and images.  When displayed, the data can move
over the screen, which is described by a <A HREF=../program/index.html>program</A>.
<P>
The actual data which is entered by the designer of the presentation
falls apart into
<A HREF=../decoration/index.html>decorations</A> (background images and text colours),
<A HREF=../dynamic/index.html>dynamics</A> (for the program),
<A HREF=../fontset/index.html>fontsets</A> (for the fonts to be used),
<A HREF=../formatter/index.html>formatters</A> (how the text is entered), and
<A HREF=../template/index.html>templates</A> (how the screen is divided into parts).

For most presentations, there will be only one viewport.  In those cases,
the existence of the slide-view is only complicating our picture.
<P>
In the picture on the right, the slide and slide-view objects are
linked as if one.  The only viewport displays one slide(view) after the
other.
<P>
The control objects are left out in this picture too, because when writing
your presentation, you are not concerned with them.
