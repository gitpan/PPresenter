# Make a copy of a style element.  Per slide, the copy is made and then

# add fields to this hash which have no default.

# Change
# User wants some settings to be changed.  But: this is dangerous, because
# in one of the previously defined slide, this style-element may already
# be used.  In that case, we add a new, changed style-element in front
# of the elements in the style.
