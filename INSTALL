- INSTALL

Portable Presenter is a fully Perl/Tk compliant package, so as
long as you have compiled a recent Perl and Tk, it should work
`out the box'.

** What do you need?

Install the following packages.  The version-numbers are indications;
it might be that earlier versions work too.
- Perl 5.005_02 or higher
  You can best use the latest stable version, which is located at
  http://www.CPAN.org/src/stable.tar.gz
- Perl/Tk 800.015      (obligatory)
  http://www.CPAN.org/modules/by-module/Tk/Tk800.015.tar.gz
- X11::Protocol v0.04  (optional)
  http://www.CPAN.org/modules/by-module/X11/X11-Protocol-0.04.tar.gz

For ImageMagick:       (optional)
from http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick/
- libjpeg.so.6      
- ImageMagick v4.2.9
- PerlMagick v4.29
The website of ImageMagick will change to www.ImageMagick.org with
the coming release of version 5.1.

You can really better install all these packages straight from
source, because in my experience, the rpms do not go nice together.

** Installing this package.

Unpack the package (hey! you did of course, otherwise you wouldn't
be able to read this messsage) with, and install:

   gzip -d < PPresenter-v*.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd PPresenter-v?.??
   perl Makefile.PL
   make install

This package does not contain any binaries.  You can install, upgrade
or remove the other packages without the need to reinstall PPresenter.

** Warning

WARNING:
   Do not run PPresenter files which you have downloaded from the Net: they
   are Perl programs, hence can perform any task on your system without
   you noticing it.
   Presentation should be distrubed as websites or postscript.  See the
   export facilities on how to create them.
