Some wishes:

- Adding TrueType-fonts support.  They may be nicer than scaling fonts.
  When you use X11, they are available (just configure the correct
  font-names), but they are not supported.

- Full tutoral on the Markup formatter.  A short version is available.

- Conversion program from the PPresenter's version of MarkUp into real HTML.

- Dump screens to Postscript.
  Works partially, but the question is whether ImageMagick, my printer, or
  PPresenter is corrupting the output when slide-images are larger than
  A5 (half of a4).  Might be solved by IM5.2 with large memory.

- Slides can only be exported as images.  need to create a covertion from
  Markup into real HTML to facilitate other exports.

- Processing command-line arguments.  Command-line arguments should be
  passed-on to the show-creation.

- Documentation on XML.

- Extention of XML.

- Language corrections of the documentation.  Requires help, because I'm
  not a native speaker.
