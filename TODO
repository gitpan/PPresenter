Some wishes:

- Adding TrueType-fonts.  They should be faster than scaling fonts.

- Full tutoral on the Markup formatter.  A short version is available.

- Conversion program from the PPresenter's version of MarkUp into real HTML.

- Dump screens to Postscript.
  Works partially, but the question is whether ImageMagick, my printer, or
  PPresenter is corrupting the output when slide-images are larger than
  A5 (half of a4).

- Dump presentation to Website.
  Now only finals of the slides.  Would be nice to permit intermediate
  slide-phases too.

- Slides can only be exported as images.  need to create a covertion from
  Markup into real HTML to facilitate other exports.
